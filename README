This program will utilize multigrid methods used to solve differential equations. To review, 
multigrid uses grids of different granularities and switches between them to increase to rate of 
convergence for the finest granularity grid while avoiding the need to compute an exact 
solution on any but the coarsest grid.

Accepts Grids throught stdin of dimensions (2^i + 1)x(2^i + 1).
